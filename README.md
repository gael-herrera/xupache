# Sample web page for Apache 2 setup

## Project Overview

This project was created for the Operating Systems Management course as a comprehensive educational resource on different types of web server hosting solutions. The website provides detailed information about the following server types:

- Dedicated Web Servers
- VPS (Virtual Private Servers)
- Shared Web Servers
- Cloud Web Servers

## Educational Purpose

The main objective of this project is to provide students with a clear understanding of different web server deployment options, their technical characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, and practical use cases. Each web server type is covered in depth to help students make informed decisions when setting up hosting environments.
